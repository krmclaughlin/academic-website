abstract: "No-till or direct seeding can be described as seeding directly into the crop stubble from the previous season without use of tillage. A reduction in tillage can result in many benefits, including increased soil organic matter, increased water holding capacity, and reduced fuel costs. However, the effect of no-till and reduced tillage on crop root disease profiles is poorly understood. To study the effect of tillage on disease dynamics, soil samples were collected from commercial wheat fields representing a wide range of tillage strategies in fall 2016 and fall 2017. Because precipitation might affect soilborne diseases, wheat fields located across a diverse gradient of precipitation zones of the dryland Pacific Northwest were selected. *Fusarium* spp., *Pythium* spp., and *Rhizoctonia* spp. were quantified from soil samples using soil dilution plating and quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays. Results of dilution plating showed that the colony counts of *Fusarium*, *Pythium*, and *Rhizoctonia* at the genus level were negatively associated with tillage. However, the same patterns were not observed when specific causal agents of *Fusarium*, *Pythium*, and *Rhizoctonia* that are known to be pathogenic on wheat were quantified with qPCR. Furthermore, precipitation affected the population density of some fungal pathogens (*F. culmorum*, *P. ultimum*, and *R. solani* AG 8). Within the scope of inference of this study, results of this study indicate that the benefits of adopting reduced tillage likely outweigh potential risk for increased root disease."
